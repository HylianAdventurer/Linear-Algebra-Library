Linear Algebra Library
by Jaron Burtnett

This is a bit of a fun project for me. I am working on creating functions that simulate Linear Algebra in multiple languages.
Eventually I plan on making some documentation on how everything works and how to use it efficiently. For now feel free to take a look and if you want to use it for any projects of yours, please do. It would be great if you gave credit to me and I would love to see what you do with it. Have fun and enjoy programming!
