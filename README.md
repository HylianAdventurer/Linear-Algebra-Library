Linear Algebra Library
by Jaron Burtnett

This is a bit of a fun project for me. I am working on creating functions that simulate Linear Algebra in multiple languages.
You can check out the Wiki page of this project for documentation on all of the functions. For now feel free to take a look and if you want to use it for any projects of yours, please do. It would be great if you gave credit to me and I would love to see what you do with it. Have fun and enjoy programming!
